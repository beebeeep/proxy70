Simple and clear HTTP proxy for browsing gopherspace via your browser.

Text-based gopher browsers are nice, but I was utterly annoyed that they tend to reload
resource every time you go back â€” and believe it or not, gopher holes are not always fast to respond. Web browsers, meantime, used to work with slow sites, so they have caches, which
makes browsing experience way faster. Oh, and also browsers can show images. 

Installation and usage
======================
Checkout repo, run `cargo run` and open http://localhost:8080
